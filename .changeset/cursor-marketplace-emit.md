Add Cursor Team Marketplace support: canonical `marketplace/source.json` registry with dual emit to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`, and `cursor-plugins/` wrappers. Move all plugins under `plugins/` for clearer repo layout. Extend CI validation and release workflow to keep emitted manifests fresh. Add husky pre-commit running `ci-validate.sh`.
