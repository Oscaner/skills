## superpowers-overrides self-check

Before your first tool call in ANY turn, run this check — no exceptions:

1. Scan the current turn for any of: a `<command-name>` tag, a `<command-message>` tag, `/superpowers:*` in user text, or a `superpowers:*` skill body appearing in system context.
2. If any is present → your **first tool call is the matching `Skill(superpowers-overrides:<name>)`**. Full stop. No `TodoWrite` / `Read` / `Bash` / `Grep` / `Edit` first.
3. Only after the override has run may you follow the upstream skill's instructions.

**The upstream skill's "you MUST do X first" does NOT apply until the override has run.**

**Anti-pattern:** upstream SKILL.md bodies open with numbered "You MUST" checklists — reading that and starting to execute it is the failure mode. The override runs first.

**Handoff-continuation rationalization:** when the upstream body arrives as a tool result of a prior `Skill(...)` call, the self-check STILL fires. Each turn is scanned independently.
